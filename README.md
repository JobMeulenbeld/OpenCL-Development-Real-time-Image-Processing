# OpenCL-Development: Real-time Image Processing

[![Build](https://github.com/Arief-AK/OpenCL-Development-Real-time-Image-Processing/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Arief-AK/OpenCL-Development-Real-time-Image-Processing/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Release](https://github.com/Arief-AK/OpenCL-Development-Real-time-Image-Processing/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Arief-AK/OpenCL-Development-Real-time-Image-Processing/actions/workflows/release.yml)

Application of OpenCL for real-time image processing on embedded hardware. This work demonstrates the development of image processing methods such as grayscale conversion, edge-detection, and Gaussian blur. The outcome of this project is to highlight OpenCL's praticality for real-world scenarios.

## OpenCL setup
OpenCL is typically packaged with graphic drivers from vendors like **AMD**, **Intel**, and **NVIDIA**. To ensure that OpenCL is properly installed on your system, install the latest graphic drivers on your device.

- For AMD GPUs, download drivers from the [AMD website](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/GPU-56.html).
- For NVIDIA GPUs, download drivers from the [NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/).
- For Intel GPUs, download drivers from the [Intel website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html).

### Linux
#### Ubuntu
```shell
sudo apt-get install clinfo ocl-icd-opencl-dev
```

#### Arch
Please refer to the [Arch documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GPGPU).

For AMD GPUs
```shell
sudo pacman -S clinfo opencl-mesa
```

For NVIDIA GPUs
```shell
sudo pacman -S clinfo opencl-nvidia
```

For Intel GPUs
```shell
sudo pacman -S intel-compute-runtime
```

## OpenCV setup
All applications in this project utilises the OpenCV library. See the official [OpenCV website](https://opencv.org/get-started/).

### Windows
Download the package from the official [OpenCV website](https://opencv.org/get-started/) or its [GitHub page](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/latest).

### Linux
#### Ubuntu
```shell
sudo apt install libopencv-dev clinfo
```

#### Arch
```shell
sudo pacman -S opencv
```

In addition to `opencv`, you may require the `hdf5` library as well. You can install this using an `AUR` package manager.
```shell
yay -S hdf5
```

## CMake Setup
> [!NOTE]\
> Ensure that `CMake` is properly installed and added to the `PATH` environment variable on your machine. See [CMake official documentation](https://cmake.org/download/).
>
>This project is developed using [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE. The [CMake Tools extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) is used extensively within the project development. It is highly recommended that users develop with VS code with this extension.

## Getting Started
> [!Important]\
> Ensure that camera source is available (webcam or USB camera).

To run the `RealtimeImageProcessing` application, run the following commands. This will build the `RealtimeImageProcesing` apllication in `Release` mode.

### Build instructions
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```
